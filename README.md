# Arithmetic_Calculator
I have created an arithmetic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can perform basic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user-friendly interface has number and operator buttons, with a display screen for results. You used HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic.
